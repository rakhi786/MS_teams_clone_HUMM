# ACHIEVING AGILE
The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases and achieved in a fixed time intervals called sprints.
The agile methodology was achieved during this project in the following sprints:
- SPRINT 1:
In Sprint 1,I explored about the libraries,APIs and frameworks to be used in the project which  included:
-WebRTC which was used to enable Web application and site to capture and optionally stream audio and video media and to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary.
-Nodejs , express for wrting the server code and organizing the application
-Socket io library for enabling a realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

- SPRINT 2 :
In sprint 2,I had implemented a basic prototype which provided a start to the project using html and css.

- SPRINT 3 :
In sprint 3,I added userâ€™s video and audio to the window with basic features like hiding/showing video , muting/unmuting audio, screen sharing,copying the meeting link and disconnecting.
Then I Connected the users using Socketio library 

- SPRINT 4 :
In sprint 4, when the surprise feature was introduced of letting the users to chat , i explored on this feature then implemented it in the project.
- SPRINT 5 :
And in the last sprint, I made the final changes that I felt like to ammend and made the documentation and the video that need to be submitted.



# Alternative
If you prefer to use PHP Web socket (Ratchet) instead of socket.io and NodeJS.
